# Illud
Illud is a minimalist and professional list management application with NFC functionality. Items can be stored locally with AES256 encryption, or transferred to an NFC tag with the benefit of hardware security. In addition, list items are compressed using ZLIB compression when exporting to an NFC tag.

Illud also understands that convenience is a top priority. Swiping list items to the left will send them straight to the top of the list for quick prioritization. Swiping left on the top-most item will send it to the bottom of the list, signifying that this item can be pushed back further in the schedule. To dismiss a list item, simply swipe it to the right.

Illud can be used with a variety of use-cases.

1) Personal To-do List:
Keep track of your day-to-day tasks and organize them to your liking in a linear fashion. Those who order their tasks by priority will find this useful.

2) Team-Oriented Environments:
Have a list of tasks that need to be accomplished by the end of the day? Have each team member scan an NFC tag with the desired tasks and complete them individually. Once an item is completed, dismiss the task and write the updated list back to the NFC tag.

3) Private Lists:
Never forget a password again by uploading them directly to your NFC tags. The only way for an attacker to steal your passwords is to steal your physical NFC tag, which greatly reduces your risk of losing your passwords.

Illud is a hobby project, and I am always open to suggestions and feedback. Don't hesitate to contact me directly.
